THE COCKTAIL HOUSE

This cocktail app was the front-end challenge as part of my bootcamp.

I have decided to take it further so I can store my favorite cocktails and share with other people.

I have coded the backend futures (all CRUD actions) so anybody can create a cocktail, see all cocktails and add reviews.

I have also added the authentication with devise gem in order to control the access what is being added.

Finally, I have uploaded this cocktail app to Heroku so everybody can enjoy the amazing cocktails.

There are more to come.

I will keep you updated :)
